Deep Audio Classification
This project is a simple end-to-end audio classification pipeline built using Python, Librosa, and TensorFlow. It loads audio files, extracts spectrogram-based features, trains a CNN model, and predicts the genre or class of an input audio sample.
The notebook walks through the entire workflow so anyone can understand how audio classification works from scratch.
